Philosophy Club at Oregon State University,"Next Meeting: March 7, 2024 @ 7PM | MU 211 | Game Night!

The Philosophy Club at Oregon State University seeks to cultivate a love of wisdom through shared community and conversation. We value providing a space for all voices and perspectives to be represented and encourage a spirit of contemplation– for as Socrates once said: “the unexamined life is not worth living."" 

Our club meetings cover a variety of topics that fall under the large umbrella of the field we call “philosophy” and are determined based on members’ interests. Generally, philosophy stems into a few main branches: Ethics (the study of morality, what is right and wrong), Epistemology (the study of knowledge, what it is, how it’s acquired), Metaphysics (the study of the fundamental nature of reality), Aesthetics (the study of beauty), Logic (the study of types of logic, logic systems), Political Philosophy (the study of governments, public agents, institutions, and more), and Axiology (the study of values)-- and the amazing thing is that most conversation topics more or less fall into these categories! Members are encouraged to voice discussion topic ideas and interests, and are more than welcome to reach out to the philosophy club council for any ideas/questions/concerns. 

Past discussion topics have included: Ethics and Morality, Existence and Reality, Philosophy and Education, Science and Society, AI and consciousness.

Our meetings may not always follow the same format, however, our general meetings will revolve around a conversation determined by the previous meeting’s attendants. In addition to big/small group discussions, meetings may also involve speaker events, group movies/readings, and social events!

While only enrolled, active student members retain the right to vote, the Philosophy Club welcomes students, faculty, and community members of all walks of life. 

We are also always looking for opportunities to put our philosophical revelations to good use by organizing events on campus or providing information that might help to improve the OSU community.

Philosophy Club is a Voluntary Student Organization of Oregon State University,  associated with the School of History, Philosophy, and Religion, and advised by Dr. Ben Stenberg. Please contact philosophyclub@oregonstate.edu with any questions about the club or with any questions about the Philosophy major or minor.

The purpose of the Philosophy Club, as according to our constitution, shall be to cultivate a love of wisdom, to examine and discuss philosophy and to highlight its importance in contemporary life and society, to promote philosophy as a subject in which to earn a major, minor, or other qualifications, to encourage students outside of the department to take philosophy classes, to create opportunities for students pursuing an education in philosophy, to bridge the gap for students interested in philosophy and studying outside the department, to explore and expand our ways of thinking even deeper, regardless of skill or experience, to connect ideas in philosophy to other areas of student life in meaningful ways, and cultivate a community around the subject of philosophy.","Sponsored Student Organization sponsored by School of History, Philosophy and Religion",philosophy.clubs@oregonstate.edu,Recognized For: 2023/2024

Women's Volleyball Club,"OSU Women's Club Volleyball provides undergraduate and graduate students an opportunity to play competitive volleyball, while focusing on their studies. We compete against other college club teams in tournaments throughout Oregon, Washington, and California, as well as at the NCVF Club Volleyball Nationals in April. Higher skilled and committed players will have the opportunity to play on the competitive traveling teams, while other players may join the club if they just want to practice and play. At the beginning of each year, the club will hold player skill assessments to determine each member's skill level. No longer a young club, we hope to continue the great participation of all of our student-athletes to grow into a more competitive team that we strive to achieve.","Department Student Organization, Rec Sports/Sport Clubs",womens.volleyball@oregonstate.edu,Recognized For: 2023/2024
